Centralized Banking System:
•	Central Control: Managed by a central authority (e.g., government or central bank).
•	Limited Access: Access to financial services may be restricted or dependent on location and status.
•	Trust Dependency: Relies on trust in the central authority to manage and secure transactions.
•	Vulnerable to Fraud: Single points of failure can be exploited by fraudsters or hackers.
•	Traditional Infrastructure: Relies on legacy systems that can be costly to maintain and upgrade.
•	Privacy Concerns: Centralized systems may require personal information and can potentially compromise user privacy.
Blockchain:
•	Decentralization: Operates on a distributed network of computers (nodes) without a central authority.
•	Accessibility: Anyone with internet access can participate in blockchain networks.
•	Trustless Transactions: Uses cryptographic methods for secure and transparent transactions without relying on trust in a single entity.
•	Resilience to Fraud: Resistant to fraud due to cryptographic security and decentralized validation.
•	Efficiency and Cost: Lower transaction fees and faster processing times due to automated consensus mechanisms.
•	Privacy and Security: Provides varying degrees of anonymity and security through cryptographic protocols.
