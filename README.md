Centralized Banking System:
•	Central Control: Managed by a central authority (e.g., government or central bank).
•	Limited Access: Access to financial services may be restricted or dependent on location and status.
•	Trust Dependency: Relies on trust in the central authority to manage and secure transactions.
•	Vulnerable to Fraud: Single points of failure can be exploited by fraudsters or hackers.
•	Traditional Infrastructure: Relies on legacy systems that can be costly to maintain and upgrade.
•	Privacy Concerns: Centralized systems may require personal information and can potentially compromise user privacy.
Blockchain:
•	Decentralization: Operates on a distributed network of computers (nodes) without a central authority.
•	Accessibility: Anyone with internet access can participate in blockchain networks.
•	Trustless Transactions: Cryptographic methods are used for secure and transparent transactions without relying on trust in a single entity.
•	Resilience to Fraud: Resistant to fraud due to cryptographic security and decentralized validation.
•	Efficiency and Cost: Lower transaction fees and faster processing times due to automated consensus mechanisms.
•	Privacy and Security: Provides varying degrees of anonymity and security through cryptographic protocols.

Blockchain technology potentially impacts health systems in City A and City B:
City A:
•	Blockchain Integration: A certain percentage (x%) of health data in City A could be managed and accessed through blockchain technology.
•	Decentralized Control: Blockchain offers a decentralized approach to storing and managing health records, reducing reliance on a single centralized database.
•	Enhanced Security: Data stored on a blockchain is encrypted and distributed across a network of computers (nodes), reducing the risk of unauthorized access and enhancing data security.
•	Patient Control: Blockchain can empower patients with greater control over their health data, allowing them to grant access to healthcare providers as needed while maintaining privacy.

City B:
•	Potential Blockchain Use: The specifics of blockchain implementation in City B are not provided, so its application could vary.
•	Hypothetical Benefits: If City B adopts blockchain, it could potentially offer similar advantages as to City A, such as enhanced security, data transparency, and patient autonomy.
•	Considerations: Adoption challenges, regulatory frameworks, and interoperability with existing healthcare systems would need to be addressed.
In both cities, blockchain technology could revolutionize healthcare by improving data integrity, security, and accessibility, while empowering patients with greater control over their health information. The actual implementation and benefits would depend on local policies, technological infrastructure, and healthcare system priorities.

Hashing Algorithm :
 Hash is like a fingerprint (human being: every person has a different identity).
Hash is generated with the help of the SHA256 algorithm
Hashing Algorithm (SHA256):
•	Definition: A hashing algorithm is a mathematical function that garbles data and makes it unreadable. 
Blockchain Structure:
Blockchain organizes data into blocks, where each block contains:
•	Data: Information such as transactions or records.
•	Previous Hash: The hash of the previous block in the chain, creating a sequential link.
•	Hash: The hash generated for the current block, which includes the data and the previous block's hash.
•	Output: SHA256 produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value, which is commonly represented as a 64-character hexadecimal string (each character represents 4 bits).
Requirements of a hashing algorithm:
   	One-way Functionality: It's easy to turn data into a hash, but extremely hard to turn a hash back into the original data.
   	Deterministic: Ensures that identical input data always generates the same hash, critical for maintaining consistency in blockchain transactions and blocks.
   	Fast Computation: Essential for handling the high transaction volumes of blockchain networks swiftly and efficiently.
   	Uniformity: Distributes hash values evenly to minimize the likelihood of different blocks having the same hash, ensuring data integrity in the blockchain.
   	Pre-image Resistance: It makes it highly impractical to reverse-engineer original data from its hash, safeguarding the immutability of recorded transactions.
   	Collision Resistance: Minimizes the chance that different blocks produce identical hash values, preserving the uniqueness and reliability of the blockchain's chronological chain.
   	Avalanche Effect: Guarantees that any change in block data results in a significantly different hash value, enabling detection of even minor tampering attempts.
   	Non-Reversible: Ensures that once data is hashed, it cannot be feasibly reconstructed back to its original form, ensuring privacy and permanence in blockchain transactions and records.
"SHA-256, a widely used hashing algorithm in blockchain, exemplifies the requirements:
•	One-way Functionality: Easily converts data to a hash but computationally impractical to reverse.
•	Deterministic: Identical blockchain data always yields the same SHA-256 hash, ensuring transaction consistency.
•	Fast Computation: Efficiently handles vast blockchain transaction volumes.
•	Uniformity: Distributes hashes evenly, reducing the chance of identical hashes for different blocks.
•	Pre-image Resistance: It's nearly impossible to derive original data from its SHA-256 hash, securing transaction integrity.
•	Collision Resistance: SHA-256 minimizes the likelihood of different transactions producing the same hash, which is crucial for blockchain reliability.
•	Avalanche Effect: Even slight changes in blockchain data drastically alter SHA-256 hashes, promptly detecting tampering.
•	Non-Reversible: Once data is hashed with SHA-256, it cannot feasibly be reversed, ensuring transaction privacy and permanence. 
benefits of immutability in blockchain: 
1.	Data Integrity: Once information is recorded in a blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring that transactions and data remain accurate and trustworthy. This guarantees the reliability of records and prevents manipulation.
2.	Trust and Transparency: Immutability enhances trust in blockchain networks by providing a secure and tamper-proof record of transactions. Participants can rely on the authenticity of the data, fostering transparency in operations.
3.	Security: Blockchain's immutability makes it highly secure against cyber threats. The use of cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms ensures that any attempt to alter the blockchain is easily detectable, maintaining the network's integrity and safeguarding against unauthorized changes.
4.	Auditability: The inability to alter blockchain data facilitates easy auditing and regulatory compliance. Auditors and regulators can easily trace transaction histories, verify records, and detect fraud without extensive manual effort.
5.	Dispute Resolution: Immutable records in blockchain provide conclusive evidence in case of disputes. Parties can verify transactions independently, reducing the need for third-party intermediaries and legal proceedings.
6.	Efficiency and Cost Savings: By ensuring data validity and reducing the need for manual verification, blockchain improves operational efficiency. This efficiency translates into cost savings by minimizing errors, enhancing trust, and streamlining processes.
The Bitcoin blockchain's immutable ledger works:
•	Transaction Records: Each Bitcoin transaction is recorded as a block in the blockchain.
•	Block Formation: Transactions are grouped into blocks, and each block contains a hash code that links it to the previous block.
•	Immutability: Once added, a block cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks, due to the cryptographic hash linking.
•	Decentralization and Consensus: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network where multiple nodes maintain copies of the blockchain. Changes require consensus among nodes.
•	Security and Trust: The immutable nature of the blockchain ensures secure and trustworthy transactions, allowing participants to verify transactions independently.
distributed P2P network in blockchain  :
 A "distributed P2P network in blockchain" refers to a network architecture where multiple computers (nodes) across a blockchain system operate as peers, meaning each node has equal power and responsibility to maintain a copy of the shared ledger, allowing for direct transactions between participants without a central authority, making the network decentralized and highly secure , essentially, every node acts as both a client and a server, communicating directly with other nodes to verify and validate transactions.
