Centralized Banking System:
• Central Control: Managed by a central authority (e.g., government or central bank).
• Limited Access: Access to financial services may be restricted or dependent on loca�on and
status.
• Trust Dependency: Relies on trust in the central authority to manage and secure
transac�ons.
• Vulnerable to Fraud: Single points of failure can be exploited by fraudsters or hackers.
• Tradi�onal Infrastructure: Relies on legacy systems that can be costly to maintain and
upgrade.
• Privacy Concerns: Centralized systems may require personal informa�on and can poten�ally
compromise user privacy.
Blockchain:
• Decentraliza�on: Operates on a distributed network of computers (nodes) without a central
authority.
• Accessibility: Anyone with internet access can par�cipate in blockchain networks.
• Trustless Transac�ons: Uses cryptographic methods for secure and transparent transac�ons
without relying on trust in a single en�ty.
• Resilience to Fraud: Resistant to fraud due to cryptographic security and decentralized
valida�on.
• Efficiency and Cost: Lower transac�on fees and faster processing �mes due to automated
consensus mechanisms.
• Privacy and Security: Provides varying degrees of anonymity and security through
cryptographic protocols.
